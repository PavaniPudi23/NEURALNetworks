A Neural Network (also called an Artificial Neural Network or ANN) is a computational model inspired by the way the human brain works. It consists of layers of simple units called neurons, which work together to learn patterns from data.

Here’s a clear, interview-style explanation:

-> Definition (Short & Perfect for Interview)

A Neural Network is a machine learning model made up of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons). Each neuron receives inputs, applies a weight, adds a bias, passes the result through an activation function, and produces an output. Neural networks learn by adjusting these weights during training to recognize patterns and make predictions.
